## 📚 About This Repository

This repo is a curated archive of **77 foundational C programs** written as part of structured lab experiments — from basic input/output and conditionals to advanced file handling, functions, recursion, and structures.  
It includes programs that demonstrate **key C programming concepts** used in real-world logic-building and university curricula.

## 🧩 What's Inside?

Each program is saved as:

```bash
extracted_programs/
├── Program1.c
├── Program2.c
├── ...
├── Program77.c
````

Every file follows this format:

```c
/* Objective: <What the program does> */

/* Theory: <Conceptual explanation> */

<Program Code>

/*
Sample Output:
<Actual test output>
*/
```
